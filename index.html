        <p>Hi, My name is Vimmi. I am a student at MIT coding program. I am learning web development using MERN stack.</p>
        <p>I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer Science from Texas State University, San Marcos in 2017. I have worked as a software engineer for more than 3 years. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
        I have worked at Banker's Toolbox in Austin, Texas for a year where I tested web applications, did bug fixing of code written in Visual Basic and SQL. I also learnt about 
       MVC architecture used to build ASP.net web applications. I automated a testing process in powershell. I also learnt about TDD (Test driven development).
      <br>
      I started my career in 2005 in a startup company called Algorism Softech pvt. ltd. situated in Haryana, India. I learnt and worked on Business Objects reports, ASP, Javascript, HTML, CSS. The 
    front end of the reports was made using ASP, Javascript, HTML, CSS. I also wrote SQL queries to retrieve data from database. I made utilities in C#.net to automate some processes.
   I created and maintained Business objects reports for Pfizer pharmaceuticals.
   <br>Then, I worked at Infosys for 1 year where I worked on a project to be deployed on handheld devices in Tesco retail stores in Europe. This software was built using .net compact framework. 
  I worked on the web services and exception handling module which are part of business layer and data layer. I also created some triggers and stored procedures in SQL. I also tested some modules and logged the bugs in the bug tracker.<br>
 Currently, I am learning ES6 version of Javascript, arrow functions, promises etc. I enjoy coding challenges and pay attention to detail. I am hardworking and try to accomplish my goals.</p><br>
