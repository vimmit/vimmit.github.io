        <h3 class="heading">My Projects</h3>
    <p>Following are the projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/vimmit/PacMen-game">Pacmen game</a></li>
        <p>Factory for making pacmen:
            You can create as many pacmen as you want and start the game using "Start Game" button at which the pacmen will move across the screen and bounce off the walls.
            When button "Add PacMan" is pressed a new pac man image is created and added to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman. Each pacman bounces off any wall it hits. <br><br>
            
            <u>How to Run:</u> Click on the button "Add PacMan". It will create a new Pac man. Click on "Start Game" button and the pac man will start moving across the screen. The speed of the Pacmen will increase if you click on "Start Game" button again.<br><br>
            
            Roadmap of future improvements: I can make Pacmen of different colors and change their size when they hit the wall.</p>
            
        <li><a href="https://github.com/vimmit/Eye-exercise">Eye-exercise</a></li>
        <p>The eyes follow the movement of the mouse. Eye and the eye balls are made using CSS. I get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer whenever the mouse moves and divide it by window's width and height respectively and get percentage of it. Then I set the top and left properties of each ball to corresponding Y and X.<br><br>
            <u>How to Run:</u> Move your mouse around the screen and the eye balls will follow your mouse pointer.<br><br>

            Roadmap of future improvements: I would add more features to make it look like a face such as mouth, nose, eyebrows and the boundary of the face.</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/vimmit/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker">Real time bus tracker</a></li>
        <p>Shows location of buses between MIT and Harvard in real time. It uses asynchronous javascript to get the bus locations from the MIT API for a particular route. <br><br>

            <u>How to Run:</u> Clone the repository in a folder on your computer. In the mapanimation.js, add your access token from the mapbox website. 
            To obtain an access token, sign in to Mapbox and visit the Account Apps page. Get a public access token and copy it to the token variable in mapanimation.js file. 
            Copy the index.html file into your browser, click on "Show stops between Harvard and MIT" button. It will show you the markers for various buses going on that route. 
            The markers move after every 12 seconds to show the current position of the bus.<br><br>
            
            Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to do it for chicago bus routes in the future. </p>
    </ul>
